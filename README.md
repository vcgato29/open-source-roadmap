# open-source-roadmap
This repository was created to increase our familiarity with open-source development, Git, and GitHub. 

## Contributing Guidelines
All conversations will start as an issue with the "discuss" label. 

Feel free to contribute any relevant information as a comment on the issue or by adding a new issue. Once concensus on a topic is reached, a summary of action and roadmap items will be added to the README.md or another markdown file where appropriate.
