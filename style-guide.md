# C-Labs Style Guide

For all style considerations not mentioned in this guide, C-Labs follows the  C# Coding Conventions Guide from Microsoft: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions

## Naming Conventions

* C-DEngine classes start with "The".
* Instances of C-DEngine classes start with "My".
* The "cde" prefix on functions is used to differentiate between the C-DEngine function and one with the same name in a public library.

## Best Practice

* No commented out, dead, or unused code is checked-in to version control.

## JSON

C-Labs follows the [Google Markdown Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md).
